          <h3>Presenting yourself is tough.</h3>
          <p>You‚Äôve "been working on it" for weeks, months, or even years (‚åõ?!) Maybe you've got one out in the wild, but it still feels "off". You know you need to make it better, but making the time to write about your projects is tough... and even when you carve out time, you don‚Äôt know where to start.</p>
          <p>Yeah, we know the dreaded pain üòñ. We've been there, too. That's why we've put together this <i>Weekend Guide to Crafting Your UX Portfolio</i>: to help you through the grueling (but ultimately rewarding) process we've seen so many other designers slog through.</p>

            <q>I was working on my portfolio for weeks, hearing all sorts of vague, non-actionable advice. It was confusing, but your guide cleared so much up for me.</q>

          <p>This guide will teach you the 20% of the stuff you need to make 80% of the impact.</p>
          <p>The stuff you can put together in a weekend, no matter where you're at today. Imagine: you pick up this guide, spend a few focused hours next weekend on your portfolio, and the following week you‚Äôll have a ‚ú® kickass portfolio ‚ú® that gets you in front of more design teams with more confidence in yourself, your work, and your process.</p>

          <p>What would you do for just one more job interview, or for a shot at presenting yourself more clearly at the next one?</p>
          <p>How about the next 5 interviews? <b>With the stuff in this guide, you‚Äôll learn how to <i>heavily</i> increase your chances at getting more interviews.</b> More interviews = more chances at landing the design job of your dreams. üòé</p>

          <ul>
            <li>What type of work should you put in your portfolio? What if you have no or little experience?</li>
            <li>How should you describe yourself? Should you change it up from person to person, or company to company?</li>
            <li>What is the bare minimum that you should include in your portfolio?</li>
            <li>Portfolios are difficult to write. How can you make it easier? How do you speed up the process?</li>
            <li>You‚Äôve heard case studies are important‚Ä¶ why? What makes a great case study?</li>
            <li>What types of companies should you look for? How do you pick between a startup, an agency, a big tech co., freelancing, or other types of companies?</li>

            <li>Do you just apply to a bunch of job postings online, or take a more specific approach? How do you find people on design teams? Do you send a cold email? Tweet them? Show up in person at their office?</li>
            <li>Do you still need a resume? What should you put in it? Do you need anything special from a standard resume?</li>
